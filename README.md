# Towards-chief-cook
* I was born in Dujiangyan(Chengdu), Sichuan province in China. I really love and miss the sichuan cuisines, especially those home-made ones. Both of my grandma and mom are chief cook, and I wish one day I can also cook as good as them. I'm also interested in other healthy and beginner friendly cuisines. This will repository will record my recipe on my way.
